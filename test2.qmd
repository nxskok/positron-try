Let's try the same thing we did in the script:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
d <- tibble(x)
d
```

and now make a normal quantile plot:


```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(sample = x)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

This is about as far from the line as you would expect to get with a sample of size `r n` from an actual normal distribution.
